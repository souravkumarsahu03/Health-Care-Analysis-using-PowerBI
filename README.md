### Introduction
Health care is a vital industry focused on improving, maintaining, and restoring the health of individuals through medical services, prevention programs, diagnostics, and treatment solutions.
 Worldwide, health care systems face growing challenges like workforce shortages, rising costs, and the need for increased capacity and innovation.

### Objective
Centralize Data: To build a single, interactive dashboard in Power BI.
Track Key Metrics: To monitor KPIs like Total Revenue, Patient Volume.
Identify Trends: To find insights on admission patterns, high-revenue medical conditions, and operational efficiency, and Average Length of Stay.

### Tools and Approach
Tool : This entire project was built using Microsoft Power BI.
Process:
Data Connection: Loaded the hospital's raw healthcare data.
Data Modeling: Cleaned the data and created DAX measures to calculate KPIs like Total Revenue and Average Length of Stay.
Visualization: Designed this interactive dashboard with simple filters for Year and Gender.

* Visualizations : I have shared a pptx file in the repository (refer that to know about the insights)

### Conclusion 

* This project is foused on business model.
* Focusing more on the total revenue based on the patient medical condition and there admission type.
* The dashboard provides specific areas for resource optimization, such as scheduling to match the predictable August admission peak and investigating why Asthma generates the lowest revenue despite comparable patient volumes.
